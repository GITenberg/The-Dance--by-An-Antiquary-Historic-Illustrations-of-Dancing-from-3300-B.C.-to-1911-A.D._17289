  <div class="chapheader">PREFACE.</div>
  <p> This sketch of the iconography of the dance does not pretend to be a history
    of the subject, except in the most elementary way. It may be taken as a summary
    of the history of posture; a complete dance cannot be easily rendered in illustration.
  </p>
  <p> The text is of the most elementary description; to go into the subject thoroughly
    would involve years and volumes. The descriptions of the various historic
    dances or music are enormous subjects; two authors alone have given 800 dances
    in four volumes.[<a id="fm_p_1" href="#fn_p_1">1</a>] </p>
  <p> It would have been interesting if some idea of the orchesography of the
    Egyptians and Greeks could have been given; this art of describing dances
    much in the manner that music is written is lost, and the attempts to revive
    it have been ineffective. The increasing speed of the action since the days
    of Lulli would now render it almost impossible. </p>
  <p> It is hoped that this work may be of some use as illustrating the costume,
    position and accessories of the dance in various periods to those producing
    entertainments. </p>
  <p> To the reader desirous of thoroughly studying the subject a bibliography
    is given at the end. </p>

    the Egyptian Pipes and Hieroglyphics of Dancing, &amp;c. Phoenician Round

  <p> In this work it is not necessary to worry the reader with speculations as
    to the origin of dancing. There are other authorities easily accessible who
    have written upon this theme. </p>
  <p> Dancing is probably one of the oldest arts. As soon as man was man he without
    doubt began to gesticulate with face, body, and limbs. How long it took to
    develop bodily gesticulation into an art no one can guess&#8212;perhaps a millennium.
  </p>
  <p> In writing of dancing, one will therefore include those gesticulations or
    movements of the body suggesting an idea, whether it be the slow movement
    of marching, or the rapid gallop, even some of the movements that we commonly
    call acrobatic. It is not intended here to include the more sensual movements
    of the East and the debased antique. </p>
  <p> Generally the antique dances were connected with a religious ritual conceived
    to be acceptable to the Gods. This connection between dancing and religious
    rites was common up to the 16th century. It still continues in some countries.
  </p>
  <p> In some of the earliest designs which have come down to us the dancers moved,
    as stars, hand in hand round an altar, or person, representing the sun; either
    in a slow or stately method, or with rapid trained gestures, according to
    the ritual performed. </p>
  <p> Dancing, music and poetry were inseparable. Dancing is the poetry of motion,
    and its connection with music, as the poetry of sound, occurs at all times.
    In our own day musical themes are marked by forms originally dance times,
    as waltz time, gavotte time, minuet time, etc. </p>

  <p> Amongst the earliest representations that are comprehensible, we have certain
    Egyptian paintings, and some of these exhibit postures that evidently had
    even then a settled meaning, and were a phrase in the sentences of the art.
    Not only were they settled at such an early period (B.C. 3000, fig. 1) but
    they appear to have been accepted and handed down to succeeding generations
    (fig. 2), and what is remarkable in some countries, even to our own times.
    The accompanying illustrations from Egypt and Greece exhibit what was evidently
    a traditional attitude. The hand-in-hand dance is another of these. </p>
  <p> The earliest accompaniments to dancing appear to have been the clapping
    of hands, the pipes,[<a id="fm_c1_1" href="#fn_c1_1">1</a>] the guitar, the
    tambourine, the castanets, the cymbals, the tambour, and sometimes in the
    street, the drum. </p>
  <p> The following account of Egyptian dancing is from Sir Gardiner Wilkinson's
    "Ancient Egypt"[<a id="fm_c1_2" href="#fn_c1_2">2</a>]:&#8212;</p>

    <p>"The dance consisted mostly of a succession of figures, in which the performers
      endeavoured to exhibit a great variety of gesture. Men and women danced
      at the same time, or in separate parties, but the latter were generally
      preferred for their superior grace and elegance. Some danced to slow airs,
      adapted to the style of their movement; the attitudes they assumed frequently
      partook of a grace not unworthy of the Greeks; and some credit is due to
      the skill of the artist who represented the subject, which excites additional
      interest from its being in one of the oldest tombs of Thebes (B.C. 1450,
      Amenophis II.). Others preferred a lively step, regulated by an appropriate
      tune; and men sometimes danced with great spirit, bounding from the ground,
      more in the manner of Europeans than of Eastern people. On these occasions
      the music was not always composed of many instruments, and here we find
      only the cylindrical maces and a woman snapping her fingers in the time,
      in lieu of cymbals or castanets. </p>
    <p> "Graceful attitudes and gesticulations were the general style of their
      dance, but, as in all other countries, the taste of the performance varied
      according to the rank of the person by whom they were employed, or their
      own skill, and the dance at the house of a priest differed from that among
      the uncouth peasantry, etc. </p>
    <p> "It was not customary for the upper orders of Egyptians to indulge in
      this amusement, either in public or private assemblies, and none appear
      to have practised it but the lower ranks of society, and those who gained
      their livelihood by attending festive meetings. </p>
    <p> "Fearing lest it should corrupt the manners of a people naturally lively
      and fond of gaiety, and deeming it neither a necessary part of education
      nor becoming a person of sober habits, the Egyptians forbade those of the
      higher classes to learn it as an amusement. </p>
    <p>"Many of these postures resembled those of the modern ballet, and the pirouette
      delighted an Egyptian party 3,500 years ago. </p>

    <p>"The dresses of the females were light and of the finest texture, a loose
      flowing robe reaching to the ankles, sometimes with a girdle. </p>
    <p> "In later times, it appears more transparent and folded in narrow pleats.[<a id="fm_c1_3" href="#fn_c1_3">3</a>]
      Some danced in pairs, holding each other's hand; others went through a succession
      of steps alone, both men and women; sometimes a man performed a solo to
      the sound of music or the clapping of hands. </p>
    <p> "A favourite figure dance was universally adopted throughout the country,
      in which two partners, who were usually men, advanced toward each other,
      or stood face to face upon one leg, and having performed a series of movements,
      retired again in opposite directions, continuing to hold by one hand and
      concluding by turning each other round (see fig. 3). That the attitude was
      very common is proved by its having been adopted by the hieroglyphic (fig.
      4) as the mode of describing 'dance.'" </p>

  <p>The ASSYRIANS probably danced as much as the other nations, but amongst the
    many monuments that have been discovered there is little dancing shown, and
    they were evidently more proud of their campaigns and their hunting than of
    their dancing. A stern and strong people, although they undoubtedly had this
    amusement, we know little about it. Of the Phoenicians, their neighbours,
    we have some illustrations of their dance, which was apparently of a serious
    nature, judging by the examples which we possess, such as that (fig. 5) from
    Cyprus representing three figures in hooded cowls dancing around a piper.
    It is a dance around a centre, as is also (fig. 6) that from Idalium in Cyprus.
    The latter is engraved around a bronze bowl and is evidently a planet and
    sun dance before a goddess, in a temple; the sun being the central object
    around which they dance, accompanied by the double pipes, the harp, and tabour.
    The Egyptian origin of the devotion is apparent in the details, especially
    in the lotus-smelling goddess (marked A on fig. 6) who holds the flower in
    the manner shown in an Egyptian painting in the British Museum (fig. 7). </p>

  <p>From the Phoenicians we have illustrated examples, but no record, whereas
    from their neighbours the Hebrews we have ample records in the Scriptures,
    but no illustrations. It is, however, most probable that the dance with them
    had the traditional character of the nations around them or who had held them
    captive, and the Philistine dance (fig. 6) may have been of the same kind
    as that around the golden calf (Apis) of the desert (Exodus xxxii. v. 19).

  <p> King David not only danced before the ark (2 Samuel vi. v. 16), but mentions
    dancing in the 149th and 150th Psalm. Certain historians also tell us that
    they had dancing in their ritual of the seasons. Their dancing seems to have
    been associated with joy, as we read of "a time to mourn and a time to dance";
    we find (Eccles. iii. v. 4) they had also the pipes: "We have piped to you
    and you have not danced" (Matthew xi. v. 17). These dances were evidently
    executed by the peoples themselves, and not by public performers. </p>

  <p>With the Greeks, dancing certainly was primarily part of a religious rite;
    with music it formed the lyric art. The term, however, with them included
    all those actions of the body and limbs, and all expressions and actions of
    the features and head which suggest ideas; marching, acrobatic performances,
    and mimetic action all came into the term. </p>
  <p>According to the historians, the Greeks attributed dancing to their deities:
    Homer makes Apollo <i>orchestes</i>, or the dancer; and amongst the early
    dances is that in his honour called the <i>Hyporchema</i>. Their dances may
    be divided into sections somewhat thus: (1) those of a religious species,
    (2) those of a gymnastic nature, (3) those of a mimetic character, (4) those
    of the theatre, such as the chorus, (5) those partly social, partly religious
    dances, such as the hymeneal, and (6) chamber dances. </p>
  <p> Grown up men and women did not dance together, but the youth of both sexes
    joined in the <i>Horm&#335;s</i> or chain dance and the <i>G&#283;r&#259;n&#335;s</i>,
    or crane (see fig. 11). </p>

  <p>According to some authorities, one of the most primitive of the first class,
    attributed to Phrygian origin, was the <i>Aloenes</i>, danced to the Phrygian
    flute by the priests of Cybele in honour of her daughter Ceres. The dances
    ultimately celebrated in her cult were numerous: such as the <i>Anthema</i>,
    the <i>Bookolos</i>, the <i>Epicredros</i>, and many others, some rustic for
    labourers, others of shepherds, etc. Every locality seems to have had a dance
    of its own. Dances in honour of Venus were common, she was the patroness of
    proper and decent dancing; on the contrary, those in honour of Dionysius or
    Bacchus degenerated into revelry and obscenity. The <i>Epilenios</i> danced
    when the grapes were pressed, and imitated the gathering and pressing. The
    <i>Anteisterios</i> danced when the wine was vatted (figs. 8, 9, 10), and
    the <i>Bahilicos</i>, danced to the sistrus, cymbals, and tambour, often degenerated
    into orgies. </p>

  <p> The <i>G&#283;r&#259;n&#335;s</i>, originally from Delos, is
    said to have been originated by Theseus in memory of his escape from the labyrinth
    of Crete (fig. 12). It was a hand-in-hand dance alternately of males and females.
    The dance was led by the representative of Theseus playing the lyre. </p>

  <p>Of the second class, the gymnastic, the most important were military dances,
    the invention of which was attributed to Minerva; of these the <i>Corybantum</i>
    was the most remarkable. It was of Phrygian origin and of a mixed religious,
    military, and mimetic character; the performers were armed, and bounded about,
    springing and clashing their arms and shields to imitate the Corybantes endeavouring
    to stifle the cries of the infant Zeus, in Crete. The Pyrrhic (fig. 13), a
    war dance of Doric origin, was a rapid dance to the double flute, and made
    to resemble an action in battle; the <i>Hoplites</i> of Homer is thought to
    have been of this kind. The Dorians were very partial to this dance and considered
    their success in battle due to the celerity and training of the dance. In
    subsequent periods it was imitated by female dancers and as a <i>pas seul</i>.
    It was also performed in the Panathenaea by Ephebi at the expense of the Choragus,
    but this was probably only a mimetic performance and not warlike. </p>

  <p> There were many other heroic military dances in honour of Hercules, Theseus,
    etc. </p>
  <p> The chorus, composed of singers and dancers, formed part of the drama, which
    included the recitation of some poetic composition, and included gesticulative
    and mimetic action as well as dancing and singing. The Dorians were especially
    fond of this; their poetry was generally choral, and the Doric forms were
    preserved by the Athenians in the choral compositions of their drama. </p>
  <p> The tragic dance, <i>Emmelia</i>, was solemn; whilst that in comedy, <i>Cordax</i>,
    was frivolous, and the <i>siccinis</i>, or dance of Satyrs, was often obscene.
    They danced to the music of the pipes, the tambour, the harp, castanets, cymbals,

  <p>The social dances, and those in honour of the seasons, fire and water, were
    numerous and generally local; whilst the chamber dances, professional dancing,
    the throwing of the <i>Kotabos</i>, and such-like, must be left to the reader's
    further study of the authors mentioned in the bibliography at the end of the
    work. </p>
  <p> It may astonish the reader to know that the funambulist or rope-dancer was
    very expert with the Greeks, as also was the acrobat between knives and swords.
    Animals were also taught to dance on ropes, even elephants. </p>
  <p> The important religious and other dances were not generally composed of
    professionals. The greatest men were not above showing their sentiments by
    dancing. Sophocles danced after Salamis, and Epaminondas was an expert dancer.
    There were dancers of all grades, from the distinguished to the moderate.
    Distinguished persons even married into excellent positions, if they did not
    already occupy them by birth. Philip of Macedon married Larissa, a dancer,
    and the dancer Aristodemus was ambassador to his Court. These dancers must
    not be confounded with those hired to dance at feasts, etc. (figs. 9, 14 and
    18). </p>

  <p> It is, however, with the dancing that we are dealing. There is little doubt
    that they were dancers in every sense; there are many ancient sepulchres in
    Etruria, with dancing painted on their walls. Other description than that
    of the pictures we do not possess, for as yet the language is a dead letter.
    There is no doubt, as Gerhardt [<a id="fm_c3_1" href="#fn_c3_1">1</a>] suggests,
    that they considered dancing as one of the emblems of joy in a future state,
    and that the dead were received with dancing and music in their new home.
    They danced to the music of the pipes, the lyre, the castanets of wood, steel,
    or brass, as is shown in the illustrations taken from the monuments. </p>

  <p> That the Phoenicians and Greeks had at certain times immense influence on
    the Etruscans is evident from their relics which we possess (fig. 20). </p>
  <p> A characteristic illustration of the dancer is from a painting in the tomb
    of the <i>Vasi dipinti</i>, Corneto, which, according to Mr. Dennis, [<a id="fm_c3_2" href="#fn_c3_2">2</a>]
    belongs to the archaic period, and is perhaps as early as 600 B.C. It exhibits
    a stronger Greek influence than some of the paintings. Fig. 21, showing a
    military dance to pipes, with other sports, comes from the <i>Grotta della
    Scimia</i>, also at Corneto; these show a more purely Etruscan character.</p>

  <p>The pretty dancing scene from the <i>Grotta del Triclinio</i> at Corneto
    is taken from a full-sized copy in the British Museum, and is of the greatest
    interest. It is considered to be of the Greco-Etruscan period, and later than
    the previous examples (fig. 22). </p>
  <p> There is a peculiarity in the attitude of the hands, and of the fingers
    being kept flat and close together; it is not a little curious that the modern
    Japanese dance, as exhibited by Mme. Sadi Yacca, has this peculiarity, whether
    the result of ancient tradition or of modern revival, the writer cannot say.
  </p>
  <p> Almost as interesting as the Etruscan are the illustrations of dancing found
    in the painted tombs of the Campagna and Southern Italy, once part of "Magna
    Grecia"; the figure of a funeral dance, with the double pipe accompaniments,
    from a painted tomb near Albanella (fig. 23) may be as late as 300 B.C., and
    those in figs. 24, 25 from a tomb near Capua are probably of about the same
    period. These Samnite dances appear essentially different from the Etruscan;
    although both Greek and Etruscan influence are very evident, they are more
    solemn and stately. This may, however, arise from a different national custom.
  </p>
  <p> That the Etruscan, Sabellian, Oscan, Samnite, and other national dances
    of the country had some influence on the art in Rome is highly probable, but
    the paucity of early Roman examples renders the evidence difficult. </p>

  <p> Rome as a conquering imperial power represented nearly the whole world of
    its day, and its dances accordingly were most numerous. Amongst the illustrations
    already given we have many that were preserved in Rome. In the beginning of
    its existence as a power only religious dances were practised, and many of
    these were of Etruscan origin, such as the Lupercalia, the Ambarvalia, &amp;c.
    In the former the dancers were demi-nude, and probably originally shepherds;
    the latter was a serious dancing procession through fields and villages. </p>

  <p> A great dance of a severe kind was executed by the Salii, priests of Mars,
    an ecclesiastical corporation of twelve chosen patricians. In their procession
    and dance, on March 1, and succeeding days, carrying the Ancilia, they sang
    songs and hymns, and afterwards retired to a great banquet in the Temple of
    Mars. That the practice was originally Etruscan may be gathered from the circumstance
    that on a gem showing the armed priests carrying the shields there are Etruscan
    letters. There were also an order of female Salii. Another military dance
    was the <i>Saltatio bellicrepa</i>, said to have been instituted by Romulus
    in commemoration of the Rape of the Sabines. </p>

  <p>The Pyrrhic dance (fig. 13) was also introduced into Rome by Julius Caesar,
    and was danced by the children of the leading men of Asia and Bithynia. </p>
  <p> As, however, the State increased in power by conquest, it absorbed with
    other countries other habits, and the art degenerated often, like that of
    Greece and Etruria, into a vehicle for orgies, when they brought to Rome with
    their Asiatic captives even more licentious practices and dances. </p>
  <p> As Rome, which never rose to the intellectual and imaginative state of Greece
    in her best period, represented wealth, commerce, and conquest, in a greater
    degree, so were her arts, and with these the lyric. In her best state her
    nobles danced, Appius Claudius excelled, and Sallust tells us that Sempronia
    "psaltere saltare elegantius"; so that in those days ladies played and danced,
    but no Roman citizen danced except in the religious dances. They carried mimetic
    dances to a very perfect character in the time of Augustus under the term
    of <i>Musica muta</i>. After the second Punic war, as Greek habits made their
    way into Italy, it became a fashion for the young to learn to dance. The education
    in dancing and gesture were important in the actor, as masks prevented any
    display of feature. The position of the actor was never recognized professionally,
    and was considered <i>infamia</i>. But the change came, which caused Cicero
    to say "no one danced when sober." Eventually the performers of lower class
    occupied the dancing platform, and Herculaneum and Pompeii have shown us the
    results. </p>

  <p> In the theatre the method of the Roman chorus differed from that of the
    Greeks. In the latter the orchestra or place for the dancing and chorus was
    about 12 ft. below the stage, with steps to ascend when these were required;
    in the former the chorus was not used in comedy, and having no orchestra was
    in tragedies placed upon the stage. The getting together of the chorus was
    a public service, or liturgia, and in the early days of Grecian prosperity
    was provided by the choregus. </p>

  <p>Tiberius by a decree abolished the Saturnalia, and exiled the dancing teachers,
    but the many acts of the Senate to secure a better standard were useless against
    the foreign inhabitants of the Empire accustomed to sensuality and licence.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps the encouragement of the more brutal combats of the Coliseum did
    something to suppress the more delicate arts, but historians have told us,
    and it is common knowledge, what became of the great Empire, and the lyric
    with other arts were destroyed by licentious preferences. </p>

  <p> The last illustration from the Baths of Constantine brought us into the
    Christian era, although that example was not of Christian sentiment or art.
    It is possible that the dance of Salome with its diabolical reward may have
    prejudiced the Apostolic era, for we find no example of dancing, as exhibiting
    joy, in Christian Art of that period. The dance before Herod is historical
    proof that the higher classes of Hebrews danced for amusement. </p>
  <p> As soon, however, as Christianity became enthroned, and a settled society,
    we read of religious dances as exhibiting joy, even in the churches. Tertullian
    tells us that they danced to the singing of hymns and canticles. These dances
    were solemn and graceful to the old tones; and continued, notwithstanding
    many prohibitions such as those of Pope Zacharias (a Syrian) in A.D. 744.
    The dancing at Easter in the Cathedral at Paris was prohibited by Archbishop
    Odo in the 12th century, but notwithstanding the antagonism of the Fathers,
    the dances were only partially suppressed. </p>
  <p> They were common on religious festivals in Spain and Portugal up to the
    seventeenth century and in some localities continue even to our own time.
    When S. Charles Borromeo was canonized in 1610, the Portuguese, who had him
    as patron, made a procession of four chariots of dancers; one to Renown, another
    to the City of Milan, one to represent Portugal and a fourth to represent
    the Church. In Seville at certain periods, and in the Balearic Isles, they
    still dance in religious ceremonies. </p>
  <p> We know that religious dancing has continually been performed as an accessory
    to prayer, and is still so used by the Mahommedans, the American Indians and
    the Bedos of India, who dance into an ecstasy. </p>

  <p> It is probable that this sort of mania marked the dancing in Europe which
    was suppressed by Pope and Bishop. This <i>choreomania</i> marked a Flemish
    sect in 1374 who danced in honour of St. John, and it was so furious that
    the disease called St. Vitus' dance takes its name from this performance.
  </p>
  <p> Christmas carols were originally choric. The performers danced and sang
    in a circle. </p>
  <p> The illustration (fig. 43) of a dance of angels and religious shows us that
    Fra Angelico thought the practice joyful; this dance is almost a counterpart
    of that amongst the Greeks (fig. 11). The other dance, by Sandro Botticelli
    (fig. 44), is taken from his celebrated "Nativity" in the National Gallery.
    Although we have records of performances in churches, no illustrations of
    an early date have come to the knowledge of the writer. </p>

  <p> That the original inhabitants of Britain danced&#8212;that the Picts, Danes,
    Saxons and Romans danced may be taken for granted, but there seems little
    doubt that our earliest illustrations of dancing were of the Roman tradition.
    We find the attitude, the instruments and the clapping of hands, all of the
    same undoubted classic character. Tacitus informs us that the Teutonic youths
    danced, with swords and spears, and Olaus Magnus that the Goths, &amp;c.,
    had military dances: still the military dances in English MSS. (figs. 31,
    32) seem more like those of a Pyrrhic character, which Julius Caesar, the
    conqueror of England, introduced into Rome. The illustration (fig. 29) of
    what is probably a Saxon gleemen's dance shows us the kind of amusement they
    afforded and how they followed classic usages. </p>

  <p> The gleemen were reciters, singers and dancers; and the lower orders were
    tumblers, sleight-of-hand men and general entertainers. What may have been
    the origin of our hornpipe is illustrated in fig. 30, where the figures dance
    to the sound of the horn in much the same attitudes as in the modern hornpipe,
    with a curious resemblance to the position in some Muscovite dances. </p>

  <p> The Norman minstrel, successor of the gleeman, used the double-pipe, the
    harp, the viol, trumpets, the horn and a small flat drum, and it is not unlikely
    that from Sicily and their South Italian possessions the Normans introduced
    classic ideas. </p>
  <p> Piers the Plowman used words of Norman extraction for them, as he speaks
    of their "Saylen and Saut&eacute;." </p>
  <p> The minstrel and harpist does not appear to have danced very much, but to
    have left this to the joculator, and dancing and tumbling and even acrobatic
    women and dancers appear to have become common before the time of Chaucer's
    "Tomblesteres." </p>

  <p> That this tumbling and dancing was common in the thirteenth century is shown
    by the illustration from the sculpture at Rouen Cathedral (fig. 34), the illustrations
    from a MS. in the British Museum (fig. 33) of Herodias tumbling and of a design
    in glass in Lincoln, and other instances at Ely; Idsworth Church, Hants; Ponc&eacute;,
    France, and elsewhere. It is suggested that the camp followers of the Crusaders
    brought back certain dances and amongst these some of an acrobatic nature,
    and many that were reprehensible, which brought down the anger of the Clergy.

  <p> In the fourteenth century, from a celebrated MS. (2 B. vii.) in the British
    Museum and other cognate sources we get a fair insight of the amusement afforded
    by these dancers and joculators. In the illustration (fig. 35) we get A and
    C tumblers, male and female; D, a woman and bear dance; and E, a dance of
    fools to the organ and bagpipe. It will be observed that they have bells on
    their caps, and it must have required much skill and practice to sound their
    various toned bells to the music as they danced. This dance of fools may have
    suggested or became eventually merged into the "Morris Dance" (fig. 50) of
    which some account with other illustrations of "Comic Dances" will be given
    hereafter. The man dancing and playing the pipes with a woman on his shoulder
    (fig. 36), the stilt dancer with a curious instrument (C), and the woman jumping
    through a hoop, give us other illustrations of fourteenth century amusements.

  <p> Concerning the dance as a means of social intercourse, it does not appear
    to have been formulated as an accomplishment until late in the thirteenth
    century, and at a later date was cultivated as a means of teaching what we
    call deportment, until it became almost a necessity with the classes, as is
    shown by the literature of that period. The various social dances, such as
    the Volte, the Jig and the Galliard, although in early periods, not so numerous,
    required a certain training and agility. These, however, soon became complicated
    with many social and local variations, the characteristics of which are a
    study in themselves. The dances (figs. 37 and 38) in a field of sports, from
    an Italian engraving of the fifteenth century, show us nothing new; indeed,
    with different costumes it is very like what we have from Egypt (fig. 3),
    only a different phase of the action, and the attitude of this old dance is
    repeated even to our own time. </p>

  <p> Fancy dress and comic dances have handed down the same characteristics almost
    to our own time. The Wildeman costume dance (fig. 41) is interesting in many
    respects, it not only shows us the dance, but the costume and general method
    of the Chamber. </p>
  <p> The fifteenth century comic dancers in a <i>f&ecirc;te champ&eacute;tre</i>
    (fig. 42) and those of the seventeenth century by Callot (fig. 52) are good
    examples of this entertainment&#8212;in the background of the latter a minuet seems
    to be in progress. The Morris dance (fig. 50) shows us the development that
    had taken place since the fourteenth century. </p>

  <p> Allusion has already been made to the beautiful paintings of Botticelli
    and Fra Angelico, which tell us of Italian choral dances of their period;
    these do not belong to social functions, but are certainly illustrative of
    the custom of their day. Albert D&uuml;rer (figs. 45, 46) has given us illustrations
    of the field dances of his period, but both these dances and those drawn by
    Sebald Beham (fig. 47) are coarse, and contrast unfavourably with the Italian,
    although the action is vigorous and robust. </p>

  <p> At the end of the sixteenth century we get a work on dancing which shows
    us completely its position as a social art in that day. It is the "Orch&eacute;sographie"
    of Thoinot Arbeau (Jean Tabouret, Canon of Langres, in 1588), from which comes
    the illustration of the "Galliarde" (fig. 49) and to which I would refer the
    reader for all the information he desires concerning this period. In this
    work much stress is laid on the value of learning to dance from many points
    of view&#8212;development of strength, manner, habits and courtesy, etc. Alas!
    we know now that all these external habits can be acquired and leave the "natural
    man" beneath. </p>

    common the bagpipe was in out-of-door dances; in the illustrations from D&uuml;rer

  <p> There were, however, various other dances of a number too considerable to

  <p> We have now arrived at the modern style of ball, so beloved by many of the
    French Monarchs. Henry IV. and Napoleon were fond of giving these in grand
    style, and in some sort of grand style they persist even as a great social
    function to our own time. The Court balls of Louis XIII. and XIV. at Versailles
    were really gorgeous ballets, and their grandeur was astonishing; this custom
    was continued under the succeeding monarchs. An illustration of one in the
    eighteenth century by August de l'Aubin (fig. 54) sufficiently shows their
    character. There is nothing new in the postures illustrated, which may have
    originated thousands of years ago. As illustrating the popular ball of the
    period, the design by Hogarth (fig. 55) is an excellent contrast. The <i>contredanse</i>
    represented was originally the old country dance exported to France and returned
    with certain arrangements added. This is a topic we need not pursue farther,
    as almost every reader knows what social dancing now is. </p>

    <p> <a id="fn_c5_1" href="#fm_c5_1"><b>Footnote 1</b></a>: The advice which
      he gives is valuable from its bearing on the customs of the 16th century.
      It even has great historical value, indicating the influence dancing has
      had on good manners. That the history of dancing is the history of manners
      may be too much insisted upon. For these reasons we insert these little
      known passages. The first has reference to the right way of proceeding at
      a ball. </p>
    <p> "Having entered the place where the company is gathered for the dance,
      choose a good young lady (honneste damoiselle) and raising your hat or bonnet
      with your right hand you will conduct her to the ball with your left. She,
      wise and well trained, will tender her left and rise to follow you. Then
      in the sight of all you conduct her to the end of the room, and you will
      request the players of instruments to strike up a 'basse danse'; because
      otherwise through inadvertance they might strike up some other kind of dance.
      And when they commence to play you must commence to dance. And be careful,
      that they understand, in your asking for a 'basse danse,' you desire a regular
      and usual one. Nevertheless, if the air of one song on which* the 'basse
      danse' is formed pleases you more than another you can give the beginning
      of the strain to them." </p>
    <p> "<i>Capriol</i>:&#8212;If the lady refuses, I shall feel very ashamed. </p>
    <p> "<i>Arbeau</i>:&#8212;A well-trained lady never refuses him who so honours
      her as to lead her to the dance. </p>
    <p> "<i>Capriol</i>:&#8212;I think so too, but in the meantime the shame of the
      refusal remains with me. </p>
    <p> "<i>Arbeau</i>:&#8212;If you feel sure of another lady's graciousness, take
      her and leave aside this graceless one, asking her to excuse you for having
      been importunate; nevertheless, there are those who would not bear it so
      patiently. But it is better to speak thus than with bitterness, because
      in so doing you acquire a reputation for being gentle and humane, and to
      her will fall the character of a 'glorieuse' unworthy of the attention paid
      her." </p>
    <p> "When the instrument player has ceased" continues our good Canon "make
      a deep bow by way of taking leave of the young lady and conduct her gently
      to the place whence you took her, whilst thanking her for the honour she
      has done you." Another extract is not wanting in flavour: "Hold the head
      and body straight, have a countenance of assurance, spit and cough little,
      and if necessity compels you, turn your face the other side and use a beautiful
      white handkerchief. Talk graciously, in gentle and honest speech, neither
      letting your hands hang as if dead or too full of gesticulation. Be dressed
      cleanly and neatly 'avec la chausse bien tir&eacute;e et Pescarpin propre.'
    </p>

  <p> Although the theatrical ballet dance is comparatively modern, the elements
    of its formation are of the greatest antiquity; the chorus of dancers and
    the performances of the men in the Egyptian chapters represent without much
    doubt public dancing performances. We get singing, dancing, mimicry and pantomime
    in the early stages of Greek art, and the development of the dance rhythm
    in music is equally ancient. </p>
  <p> The Alexandrine Pantomime, introduced into Rome about 30 B.C. by Bathillus
    and Pylades, appears to have been an entertainment approaching the ballet.
  </p>
  <p> In the middle ages there were the mysteries and "masks"; the latter were
    frequent in England, and are introduced by Shakespere in "Henry VIII." </p>
  <p> In Italy there appears to have been a kind of ballet in the 14th century,
    and from Italy, under the influence of Catharine de' Medici, came the ballet.
    Balthasar di Beaujoyeulx produced the first recorded ballet in France, in
    the Italian style, in 1582. This was, however, essentially a Court ballet.
  </p>
  <p> The theatre ballet apparently arose out of these Court ballets. Henry III.
    and Henry IV., the latter especially, were very fond of these entertainments,
    and many Italians were brought to France to assist in them. Pompeo Diabono,
    a Savoyard, was brought to Paris in 1554 to regulate the Court ballets. At
    a later date came Rinuccini, the poet, a Florentine, as was probably Caccini,
    the musician. They had composed and produced the little operetta of "Daphne,"
    which had been performed in Florence in 1597. Under these last-mentioned masters
    the ballet in France took somewhat of its present form. This passion for Court
    ballets continued under Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. </p>
  <p> Louis XIII. as a youth danced in one of the ballets at St. Germain, it is
    said at the desire of Richelieu, who was an expert in spectacle. It appears
    that he was encouraged in these amusements to remedy fits of melancholy. </p>
  <p> Louis XIV., at seven, danced in a masquerade, and afterwards not only danced
    in the ballet of "Cassandra," in 1651, but did all he could to raise the condition
    of the dance and encourage dancing and music. His influence, combined with
    that of Cardinal Richelieu, raised the ballet from gross and trivial styles
    to a dignity worthy of music, poetry and dancing. His uncle, Gaston of Orleans,
    still patronized the grosser style, but it became eclipsed by the better.
    Lulli composed music to the words of Moli&egrave;re and other celebrities;
    amongst notable works then produced was the "Andromeda" of Corneille, a tragedy,
    with hymns and dances, executed in 1650, at the Petit Bourbon. </p>
  <p> The foundation of the theatrical ballet was, however, at the instigation
    of Mazarin, to prevent a lowering of tone in the establishment of the <i>Acad&eacute;mie
    de Danse</i> under thirteen Academicians in 1661. This appears to have been
    merged into the <i>Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Musique et de Danse</i> in 1669,
    which provided a proper training for d&eacute;butants, under MM. Perrin and
    Cambert, whilst Beauchamp, the master of the Court ballets, had charge of
    the dancing. The first opera-ballet, the "Pomona" of Perrin and Cambert, was
    produced in 1671. To this succeeded many works of Lulli, to whom is attributed
    the increased speed in dance music and dancing, that of the Court ballets
    having been slow and stately. </p>
  <p> The great production of the period appears to have been the "Triumph of
    Love" in 1681, with twenty scenes and seven hundred performers; amongst these
    were many of the nobility, and some excellent <i>ballerine</i>, such as Pesaut,
    Carr&eacute;, Leclerc, and Lafontaine. </p>
  <p> A detailed history of the ballet is, however, impossible here, and we must
    proceed to touch only on salient points. It passed from the Court to the theatre
    about 1680 and had two characteristics, one with feminine dancers, the other
    without. </p>

  <p> It is not a little curious that wearing the mask, a revival of the antique,
    was practised in some of these ballets. The history of the opera-ballet of
    those days gives to us many celebrated names of musicians, such as Destouches,
    who gave new "verve" to ballet music, and Rameau. Jean Georges Noverre abolished
    the singing and established the five-act ballet on its own footing in 1776.
    In this it appears he had partly the advice of Garrick, whom he met in London.
    The names of the celebrated dancers are numerous, such as P&eacute;court,
    Blaudy (who taught Mlle. Camargo), Laval, Vestris, Germain, Prevost, Lafontaine,
    and Camargo (fig. 61), of the 18th century; Taglioni, Grisi, Duvernay, Cerito,
    Ellsler, etc., of the 19th century, to those of our own day. A fair notice
    of all of these would be a work in itself. </p>

  <p> The introduction of the ballet into England was as late as 1734, when the
    French dancers, Mlle. Sall&eacute;, the rival of Mlle. Camargo, and Mlle.
    de Subligny made a great success at Covent Garden in "Ariadne and Galatea,"
    and Mlle. Salle danced in her own choregraphic invention of "Pygmalion," since
    which time it has been popular in England, when those of the first class can
    be obtained. There are, however, some interesting and romantic circumstances
    connected with the ballet in London in the last century, which it will not
    be out of place to record here. Amongst the dancers of the last century of
    considerable celebrity were two already mentioned, Mlles. Duvernay (fig. 62)
    and Taglioni (fig. 64), whose names are recorded in the classic verse of "Ingoldsby."

  <p> Mlle. Duvernay was a Parisian, and commenced her study under Barrez, but
    subsequently was under Vestris and Taglioni, the father of the celebrity mentioned
    in the verse. </p>
  <p> Duran hangs over the mantelpiece of the refectory of the presbytery. </p>
  <p> Having made a great Parisian reputation, she came to London in 1833, and
    from that date until 1837 held the town, when she married Mr. Stephens Lyne
    Stephens, M.P., a gentleman of considerable wealth, but was left a childless
    widow in 1861, and retired to her estate at Lyneford Hall, Norfolk, living
    in retirement and spending her time in good works. She is said to have spent
    &pound;100,000 in charities and churches, and that at Cambridge, dedicated
    to the English martyrs, was founded, completed, and endowed by her. She led
    a blameless and worthy life, and died in 1894. Her portrait by Mlle. Taglioni

    in 1847, and with her marriage came an ample fortune; unfortunately the bulk
    of this fortune was lost in the Franco-German war. With the courage of her
    character the Countess returned to London and gave lessons in dancing, etc.,
    in which she was sufficiently successful to obtain a fair living. She died
    in 1884 at 80 years of age. Of the other celebrities of the period&#8212;Carlotta
    Grisi, Ferraris (fig. 65), and Fanny Ellsler (fig. 63)&#8212;some illustrations

    others of lesser notoriety performing in London at this great period of the

  <p> The recent encouragement of the classic ballet has introduced us to some
    exquisite dancers: amongst these are Mlle. Adeline Gen&eacute;e (fig. 66)
    and Mlle. Anna Pavlova (fig. 67); the latter, with M. Mordkin and a corps
    of splendid dancers, are from Russia, from whence also comes the important
    troupe now at the Alhambra with Mlle. Geltzer and other excellent dancers.
    The celebrated company at Covent Garden, and Lydia Kyasht at the Empire, are
    also Russian. It is not surprising that we get excellent dancing from Russia;
    the school The recent encouragement of the classic ballet has introduced us
    to some exquisite dancers: amongst these are Mlle. Adeline Gen&eacute;e (fig.
    66) and Mlle. Anna Pavlova (fig. 67); the latter, with M. Mordkin and a corps
    of splendid dancers, are from Russia, from whence also comes the important
    troupe now at the Alhambra with Mlle. Geltzer and other excellent dancers.
    The celebrated company at Covent Garden, and Lydia Kyasht at the Empire, are
    also Russian. It is not surprising that we get excellent dancing from Russia;
    the school formed by Peter the Great about 1698 has been under State patronage
    ever since. </p>
  <p> Notices of all the important dancers from Italy, Spain, Paris, or elsewhere,
    performing in England in recent years, would occupy considerable space, and
    the reader can easily obtain information concerning them elsewhere. </p>
  <p> That the technique and speed of the classic dance has considerably increased
    is historically certain, and we must hope that this speed will not sacrifice
    graceful movement. Moreover, technique alone will not make the complete fine-artist:
    some invention is involved. Unfortunately, some modern attempts at invention
    seem crude and sensational, whilst lacking the exquisite technique desirable
    in all exhibitions of finished art. </p>
  <p> Before concluding it is almost imperative to say something about the naked
    foot dancers, followers of Isidora Duncan. Some critics and a certain public
    have welcomed them; but is it not "sham antique"? It does not remind one of
    the really classic. Moreover, the naked foot should be of antique beauty,
    which in most of these cases it is not. Advertisements tell us that these
    dance are interpretations of classic music&#8212;Chopin, Weber, Brahms, etc.; they
    are not really interpretations, but distractions! We can hardly imagine that
    these composers intended their work for actual dancing. One can listen and
    be entranced; one sees the dancer's "interpretations" or "translations" and
    the music is degraded to a series of sham classic postures. </p>
  <p> The idea that running about the stage in diaphanous costumes, with conventional
    mimicry and arm action, is classic or beautiful is a mistake; the term aesthetic
    may cover, but not redeem it. There is not even the art of the ordinary ballet-dancer
    discernible in these proceedings. </p>
  <p> On another plane are such as the ballets in "Don Giovanni" and "Faust."
    Mozart and Gounod wrote these with a full knowledge of the method of interpretation
    and the persons who had been trained for that purpose&#8212;the performers fit
    the music and it fits them. This opera-ballet is also more in accordance with
    tradition before the time of Noverre. </p>
  <p> Neither do the "popular" and curious exhibitions of Loie Fuller strike one
    as having a classic character, or future, of any consideration, pretty as
    they may be. </p>
  <p> The operetta or musical comedy has given us some excellent art, especially
    at the end of the 19th century, when Sylvia Gray, Kate Vaughan, Letty Lind,
    Topsy Sinden, and others of like <i>m&eacute;tier</i> gave us skirt and drapery
    dancing. </p>
  <p> This introduces us to the question of costume. That commonly used by the
    <i>prima ballerina</i> is certainly not graceful; it was apparently introduced
    about 1830, presumably to show the action and finished method of the lower
    extremities. If Fanny Ellsler and Duvernay could excel without this ugly contrivance,
    why is it necessary for others? </p>
  <p> At the same time it is better than indifferent imitations of the Greek,
    or a return to the debased characteristics of Pompeiian art, in which the
    effect of the classic and fine character of the material are rendered in a
    sort of transparent muslin. </p>
  <p> With these notices the author's object in this sketch is completed. Of the
    <i>bal-masqu&eacute;</i> garden dances, public balls and such-like, he has
    no intention to treat; they are not classic dancing nor "art," with the exception
    perhaps of the Scottish reels. Nor is he interested in the dancing of savage
    tribes, nor in that of the East, although some few illustrations are given
    to illustrate traditions: for example, the use of the pipe and tabor in Patagonia,
    the dancer from Japan, winged, like that in the "Roman de la Rose" (fig. 40),
    and the religious dance of Tibet, showing the survival of the religious dance
    in some countries. In Mrs. Groves' book on dancing there is an excellent chapter
    on the Ritual dance as now practised, to which the reader can refer. </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
